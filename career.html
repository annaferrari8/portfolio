    <h4><em> My Studies | Extended Version</em></h4> 
    <br>
    <p class="p_career">As the reader can certainly tell, last year I decided to change my career and now I am moving towards the tech field.
        I studied IT in high school and I was always fascinated by the logic behind it, but I never loved it enought to pursue a career in it. However, I am very good at languages <em>(I learned English and Spanish pretty easily)</em>. It was only when a friend of mine in the web development field told me about their job that an insight hit me: "web development is just learning another language but with a waaay simpler grammar!". 
        <br/> 
        And this is the story of how I got here; if you want to know more just <a href="contacts.html" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 17 px;">contact me!</a></p>
        <br>
     
        <h4><em>My Work Experience | Extended Version </em></h4> 
        <br>
        <p class="p_career">As you may guess from the list of jobs I have done, I am <em>eclectic</em>. 
            <br>
            I worked for a year in Turin's Municipality Office dedicated to the management of waste collection in the urban area. 
            Moreover, I was also a SMM assistant and in that field I handled posts, articles and newsletters. 
            Finally, a group of friend and I started a podcast called <em>Geopolitales</em>, where we talked about geopolitical events, and managed an Instagram page about it (+1k followers).
            <br> 
            What my work experience can tell about me is that I am <em>curious</em> and <em>eager to learn</em> new stuff! </p>
