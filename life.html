                <h3>Plants</h3>
                <p>I developed a passion for gardening two years ago, when I moved into a new apartment and I needed some beauty (and company).
                    <br> 
                It started as nothing serious, but as soon as I witnessed the amazing process of a leaf blossoming, I was forever in love.

                <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>I have been a reader since a I can remember. 
                    <br>
                    When I was a teenager I spent most nights reading. To me, reading is another form of interaction with people and with their thoughts, and since I am so interested in getting to know humanity, it was just another way of exploring relationships (a way that also made me better at languages!)
